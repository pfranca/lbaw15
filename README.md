## Questions & Answers

Our product is a cooperative Q&A web app developed using PHP(Laravel), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and PostegresSQL as the DBMS. The app allows any visitor to watch all the page contents (questions, answer, profile pages, search page) as well as the abillity to log in and Register in the app. An authenticated user can do all the thing a visitor can plus actions (submit a question and/or answer, upvote/downvote, follow, edit it's own profile, report). An Administrator can again do all the things an auth user can plus he has administrative rights (delete any question/answer, delete/create new topics, answer reports, ban users, etc..)
